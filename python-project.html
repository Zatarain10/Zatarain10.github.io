        <h2>Written Response</h2>
        <p class = "paragraph">In our Python Project we decided to make a quiz. One of the difficulties that we experienced while making the quiz, was figuring out how to stop our quiz (more specifically a while loop that controlled our game) when a player had won or lost. To solve the problem I made a state variable, that helped in moving the player to the next question if they got it the answer correct, and ending the game when they got the answer incorrect. Another problem my team and I experienced was finding out how to make our questions be chosen at random.</p>
