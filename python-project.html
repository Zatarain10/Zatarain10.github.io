        <h2>Written Response</h2>
        <p>For our Python Project we decided to create a quiz that randomly assigns you a question. As we  were making our quiz we encountered some difficulties. One of the difficulties that we experienced while making the quiz, was figuring out how to stop our quiz from repeating infinitely (more specifically a while loop that controlled our game) when a player had won or lost. To solve the problem I made a state variable, that helped in moving the player to the next question if they got it the answer correct, and ending the game when they got the answer incorrect. Another problem my team and I experienced was finding out how to make our questions be chosen at random. To solve the problem we researched how to use the random function. My teammates in the end found out how to input it into the code without it repeating the questions already selected. In the end, I individually created the state variable system, a now deleted score system, and created some functions to shorten the code for our quiz.</p>
